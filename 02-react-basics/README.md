# Getting Started with Create React App

Use command `npx create-react-app` to create a ready-made react project.

## Run project in development mode

Just write `npm start` to see the project's live view. It is useful to see changes continously as we implement our code.

## JSX

**JSX** allows us to write html in **JavaScript**
We can name the extension of the file as either _.js_ or _.jsx_. Both works the same way.

## How react works

In react, we declare various components and then use and place those components in correct places, just lego boxes to create some shape.

React completely works on compnent base methodology and requires us to write code in declarative way.

A component in react is simply a **JavaScript** function. We write intended _html / jsx_ code in the return statement of that function.

Data is shared between different components through the use of props. Usually, we define these as properties of our custom components where we are using those.
